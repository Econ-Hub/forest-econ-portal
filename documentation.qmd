# Data Sources and Methods

## Data Sources

The primary data source for the **NA Starts** dashboard is the **Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)**.

- **Table:** New Housing Construction, Starts (SAAR)
- **Geography:** Canada (Country Level)
- **Data Frequency:** Monthly, Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rates (SAAR)

The data is retrieved directly from the CMHC website.

## Methodology

The forecasts provided on this portal are intentionally lightweight and transparent benchmarks.

### Forecast Model: Random Walk with Drift

For each dwelling type (Single, Semi, Row, Apartment, and Total), we employ a **Random Walk with Drift** model.

- **History:** The model considers the last 5 years of historical data for context.
- **Drift Calculation:** The drift parameter is estimated as the median month-over-month change observed over the last 10 years.
- **Projection:** Future values are projected by applying this constant drift to the most recent historical data point.

This approach serves as a baseline to provide context rather than a precise predictive tool.
